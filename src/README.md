## /src Folder Structure

## /assets

The _assets_ folder is where you'll find all the static resources of the project, such as images, fonts, icons, and other media files.

## /components

_components_ houses all the reusable React components in the project. Each component is encapsulated, meaning it has its own styles, logic, and markup. Components can be easily combined and reused throughout the application, ensuring a consistent look and feel.

## /constants

The _constants_ folder contains files with predefined values that remain unchanged throughout the application.

## /hooks

In the _hooks_ folder, you will find custom React hooks that abstract and manage complex logic or side effects.

## /pages

The _pages_ folder contains components that represent individual pages or views in the application. Each file in this folder is responsible for the layout and rendering of a specific page or view.

## /styles

The _styles_ folder contains global styling files and style-related utilities. This is where you'll find the base styles, theme configuration, and any CSS-in-JS or CSS preprocessor files.

## /types

In the _types_ folder, you'll find TypeScript type definitions and interfaces for the entire project.

## /utils

The _utils_ folder stores utility functions, data processing, or any other code that assists your components and pages.
